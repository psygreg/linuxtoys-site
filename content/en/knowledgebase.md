# Knowledge Base

## Basic LinuxToys Feature Guidelines

- Features will only be made available in systems that they are compatible with *and* relevant on.
- All features and resources within the application must always follow the **KISS** (*Keep It Simple, Stupid*) principle - they must be easy to understand and utilize through their labels and quick descriptions.
- Features must be made in the way they will work **optimally** for the user.
- User interaction is limited to `zenity` prompts to avoid unpredictabilities and ensure reliability.
- Flatpaks should be used whenever possible for their **consistency** through flatpak runtimes and **security** through granular permission control.

## Custom Procedures

Require a custom installation procedure or specific tweaks to get them to work optimally, that are implemented by LinuxToys. Usually also offer removal if already installed, unless that is not necessary (if removing the main flatpak or package will undo the other changes) or removal instructions are given here.

### Docker

Installs the official Docker repositories (except for Arch Linux and OpenSUSE, that won't need them) and all packages needed from there through your system's package manager, then adds your user to the `docker` usergroup and installs Portainer CE, which runs constantly in the background since its purpose is to be a Docker dashboard and it uses negligible resources from the machine. 

**Packages Installed or Updated**
- Arch:`docker docker-compose curl dialog git iproute2 libnotify`
- Fedora: `docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin curl dialog git iproute libnotify`
- OpenSUSE:`docker docker-compose curl dialog git iproute2 libnotify-tools`
- Debian/Ubuntu: `docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin curl dialog git iproute2 libnotify-bin`

**Portainer CE installation**
```
sudo docker volume create portainer_data
sudo docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:lts
```

### Godot Engine

Both **Godot** and **GodotSharp** are installed through a custom procedure, as Godot doesn't provide standard packages. *GodotSharp* includes the installation of **.NET SDK** as also described in this documentation, required for its functions.

- Installed files location: `$HOME/.local/godot`
- App menu shortcut location: `$HOME/.local/share/applications`

### Jetbrains Toolbox

Downloads the latest tarballed release from the official website and installs it through a custom procedure, as JetBrains only provides AppImages otherwise, which are knowingly unreliable.

- Installed files location: `$HOME/.local/jetbrains-toolbox`
- App menu shortcut location: `$HOME/.local/share/applications`

### Mise

Installs using the officially provided installation script, then follows its documentation to set up autocompletions, a much desired feature of it, for `bash`, `zsh` and `fish` shells; and displays its documentation when finished in your browser. It cannot be used with `zsh` shells on immutable (`rpm-ostree`-based systems) due to immutability restrictions. Removal should follow their documentation and cannot be done through LinuxToys.

### Node Version Manager (NVM)

Installs using the officially provided installation script, or through a manual setup for `rpm-ostree`-based distributions since the official script doesn't work for them; then installs `yarn` through `npm` and displays their documentation in your browser. Removal can be done following their documentation, or by simply removing `$HOME/.nvm` for `rpm-ostree`-based systems.

**Packages Installed or Updated**
- **All systems**: `nodejs npm`
- **From NPM**: `yarn`

### PyEnv

Installs all required dependencies, installs *PyEnv* using its official script, then sets up its path into your `bash` and `zsh` profile files and displays their documentation in your browser. Removal should follow their documentation and cannot be done through LinuxToys.

**Packages Installed or Updated**
- Arch: `base-devel openssl zlib xz tk`
- Fedora: `make gcc patch zlib-devel bzip2 bzip2-devel readline-devel sqlite sqlite-devel openssl-devel tk-devel libffi-devel xz-devel libuuid-devel gdbm-libs libnsl2`
- OpenSUSE:`gcc automake bzip2 libbz2-devel xz xz-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel readline-devel zlib-devel tk-devel libffi-devel sqlite3-devel gdbm-devel make findutils patch`
- Debian/Ubuntu: `make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev`


### Tailscale

Installs using their official installation script. Can be removed through the same script.

### Kernel Module Signing for RPM-OSTree

Sets a **MOK** (Machine Owner Key) that is generated randomly and unique to your machine; then installs [akmods-keys](https://github.com/CheariX/silverblue-akmods-keys) to sign kernel modules with it in the future. Required to make *Nvidia*, *VirtualBox* and other kernel module drivers work with Secure Boot enabled. It's automatically triggered when installing Nvidia drivers on `rpm-ostree`-based immutable systems if Secure Boot is enabled at the time of installation.

### Radeon Open Compute (ROCm)

Installs all ROCm packages and diagnostic tools required for it to work properly and adds your user to the `render` and `video` usergroups, required to make `/dev/kfd` - that is required by ROCm - accessible without root.

**Packages Installed or Updated**
- Arch: `comgr hsa-rocr rccl rocalution rocblas rocfft rocm-smi-lib rocsolver rocsparse rocm-device-libs rocm-smi-lib rocminfo hipcc hiprand hip-runtime-amd radeontop rocm-opencl-runtime ocl-icd clinfo`

### Realtek RTL8821CE Driver

Installs [RTL8821CE Driver by Tomás Pinho](https://github.com/tomaspinho/rtl8821ce.git) and all its dependencies, replacing and blacklisting the default RTW8821CE driver that comes with the kernel, that doesn't work properly or at all with some devices. 

**Packages Installed or Updated**

```
RUSTICL_ENABLE=radeonsi
OCL_ICD_VENDORS=/etc/OpenCL/vendors/rusticl.icd
```

### Xpadneo

**Packages Installed or Updated**
- Arch: `dkms linux-headers bluez bluez-utils`
- Fedora: `dkms make bluez bluez-tools kernel-devel kernel-headers`
- OpenSUSE:`dkms make bluez kernel-devel kernel-source`
- Debian/Ubuntu: `dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)`

### Distrobox Command Helper

Installs files required to redirect commands from distroboxes to the host if the command is not found within the distrobox for `bash` and `zsh`; then sources them on `.bashrc` and `.zshrc`. Removal can be done simply deleting the folder with the files.

**Installed files location**
`$HOME/.local/distrobox-handler`

### Streaming Codecs for Fedora/OpenSUSE

Install the codecs required for streaming media on those operating systems.

**Packages Installed or Updated**
- Fedora: `libavcodec-freeworld`
- OpenSUSE:`opi` and, from opi, `codecs`

### Microsoft CoreFonts

Downloads the files from [SourceForge](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/corefonts), then uses `cabextract` to extract the font installers and installs the fonts in `$HOME/.local/share/fonts`. Removal can be done removing the CoreFonts folders from `$HOME/.local/share/fonts`.

**Packages Installed or Updated**
- All systems: `cabextract`

### Split-lock Mitigation Disabler

Disables split-lock mitigation, which was done to enforce good development practices on Linux, but results in significant performance loss in older applications and several games, specially from *Playstation Studios*, which are not made taking Linux into consideration. Since it is not a security feature, it's safe to disable. This is done by a `99-splitlock.conf` file that injects the proper kernel parameter. Removal can be done by removing the file.

**Installed file**
`/etc/sysctl.d/99-splitlock.conf` > `kernel.split_lock_mitigate=0`

### EarlyOOM

Force-closes a memory-hungry or leaking application in case of extreme memory and swap pressure, avoiding an 'out of memory' situation, which Linux systems knowingly react poorly to, as the heauristic scanning performed by the kernel to decide which process to close can take several hours.

**Packages Installed or Updated**
- All systems: `earlyoom`

**Custom setting applied**
```
EARLYOOM_ARGS="-r 0 -m 2 -M 256000 --prefer '^(Web Content|Isolated Web Co)$' --avoid '^(dnf|apt|pacman|rpm-ostree|packagekitd|gnome-shell|gnome-session-c|gnome-session-b|lightdm|sddm|sddm-helper|gdm|gdm-wayland-ses|gdm-session-wor|gdm-x-session|Xorg|Xwayland|systemd|systemd-logind|dbus-daemon|dbus-broker|cinnamon|cinnamon-sessio|kwin_x11|kwin_wayland|plasmashell|ksmserver|plasma_session|startplasma-way|sway|i3|xfce4-session|mate-session|marco|lxqt-session|openbox|cryptsetup)$'"
```

### GRUB-btrfs

Displays btrfs snapshots in your GRUB boot menu, perfect to select a previous snapshot in case you need to restore a broken system. Cloned and installed from its official [repository](https://github.com/Antynea/grub-btrfs); then custom settings are applied. Requires `grub`, and will not go ahead if `grub` is not found in your system. Removal should follow their documentation and cannot be done through LinuxToys.

**Packages Installed or Updated**
- Arch: `gawk inotify-tools`
- Fedora/OpenSUSE/Debian/Ubuntu: `gawk inotify-tools make`

**Custom settings applied**
- Sets a default 'root' snapper configuration, with the following changes from snapper defaults:
```
TIMELINE_CREATE="no"
NUMBER_LIMIT="5"
NUMBER_LIMIT_IMPORTANT="5"
NUMBER_CLEANUP="yes"
EMPTY_PRE_POST_CLEANUP="yes"
```
It then enables `snapper-boot.timer` and `snapper-cleanup.timer` systemd services.

### iNet Wireless Daemon

A wireless network daemon made by Intel, that has better overall performance and latency than the default `wpa_supplicant`, however may not be compatible with certain enterprise networks.

**Packages Installed or Updated**
- All systems: `iwd`

**Custom settings applied**
- `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/iwd.conf`
```
[device]
wifi.backend=iwd
```
- Disables `wpa_supplicant` systemd service.

### LucidGlyph

Installed using the official script from its [repository](https://github.com/maximilionus/lucidglyph).

### CPU ondemand

Changes the default GPU governor to `ondemand` (`powersave` is the default for most distributions), making CPU frequencies more reactive and increasing system responsiveness and performance, at a slight average power draw increase. Not recommended on laptops for their limited thermal dissipation capabilities.

**Custom settings applied**
- For *Intel* CPUs, the `intel_pstate` driver prevents the usage of `ondemand` governor and has to be disabled first:
```
if [ -n "${GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX}" ]; then
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="${GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX} intel_pstate=disable"
else
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="intel_pstate=disable"
fi
export GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX
```
- Creates and enables a new systemd service: `/etc/systemd/system/set-ondemand-governor.service`
```
[Unit]
Description=Set CPU governor to ondemand
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'for cpu in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor; do echo ondemand > "$cpu" 2>/dev/null || true; done'
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Power Optimizer

Installs `power-options` to manage power settings intuitively and in great detail through a GTK interface through its official script or through the [leo/power-options COPR repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/leo/power-options). Includes its tray icon. Removal should follow their documentation and cannot be done through LinuxToys, except for Atomic Fedora users, which can remove it by just removing the `power-options` package.

**Packages Installed or Updated**
- Arch: `gtk4 libadwaita`
- Fedora/OpenSUSE: `gtk4-devel libadwaita-devel`
- Debian/Ubuntu: `libgtk4-dev libadwaita-1-dev`
- Atomic Fedora (`rpm-ostree`): ``gtk4-devel libadwaita-devel power-options`

### Psycachy Kernel

Not available for other operating systems. Downloaded and install from its [official repository's](https://github.com/psygreg/linux-psycachy) latest releases.

**Packages Installed or Updated**
- Debian/Ubuntu: `linux-image-psycachy_$(uname -r) linux-headers-psycachy_$(uname -r) linux-libc-dev_$(uname -r)`

### Shader Booster

A patch to the shell login configuration file that enables a larger shader cache size for any GPU, eliminating stutters and FPS drops in several modern games. Reminder: it will not take the entire space unless it really needs to. Can be reverted by just removing the appended lines to `.bash_profile`, `.profile` or `.zshrc`.

**Custom settings applied**
- *AMD* and *Intel* GPUs
```
# enforce RADV vulkan implementation for AMD GPUs
export AMD_VULKAN_ICD=RADV

# increase AMD and Intel cache size to 12GB
export MESA_SHADER_CACHE_MAX_SIZE=12G
```
- *Nvidia* GPUs
```
# increase Nvidia shader cache size to 12GB
export __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_SIZE=12000000000
```

### OpenSUSE SELinux Policy Fix

Fixes an issue where SELinux prevents anything from running through WINE/Proton on OpenSUSE. Can be reverted by using the same command with `0` as the boolean value instead of `1`. 

**Custom settings applied**
```
setsebool -P selinuxuser_execmod 1
```

### Swapfile Creator

Creates an 8GB swapfile, either at `/swapfile` or `/home/swapfile` (`/home/swap/swapfile` for btrfs filesystems). Includes the necessary tweaks for the swapfile to work correctly in btrfs filesystems, avoiding a flood of snapshots. 

**Removal**
```
sudo swapoff SWAPFILE_PATH
sudo rm -rf SWAPFILE_PATH
```
Then remove the swapfile entry from `/etc/fstab`. 

### Firewall Setup

Installs the required packages, then applies sane defaults that are ideal for most users. 

**Packages Installed or Updated**
- All systems: `ufw gufw`

**Custom settings applied**
```
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw enable
```

### Oversteer

Installs the application from Flathub, applies the required `udev` configuration files for it to work at `/etc/udev/rules.d`, then displays documentation on supported devices on your browser. The configuration files are obtained from its [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/berarma/oversteer). 

### DaVinci Resolve

Offers installation through [DaVinciBox](https://github.com/zelikos/davincibox) following standard dependencies and procedures for it, or native installation through custom procedures. The *Studio* version requires a license purchased from Blackmagic Design. Removal can be done by unexporting the app shortcuts and erasing the distrobox for *DaVinciBox* following the instructions in its repository; using the uninstaller from the applications menu on Fedora/OpenSUSE; or simply removing the package through your package manager in other systems.

**Packages Installed or Updated for native installation**
- Arch: `davinci-resolve` or `davinci-resolve-studio`
